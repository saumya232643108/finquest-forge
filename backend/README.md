# Backend (Supabase)

This project uses Supabase for backend capabilities (auth, database, storage, realtime). No server code is needed here. Configure tables/policies via Supabase Dashboard. Edge functions can be added later if needed.

- Tech: Supabase (managed), RLS policies, optional Edge Functions
- Local dev: Frontend runs at http://localhost:8080 and communicates with Supabase via client SDK.
